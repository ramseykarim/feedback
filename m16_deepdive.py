A designated place for even MORE nice M16 images
Descended from m16_investigation and m16_pictures

Created: July 9, 2021
Starting with investigating the "light feature" over P2 and repeating some
transverse PV diagrams
I hope the paper is within reach. Maybe august?? Rise and grind

m16_investigation got too long so I'm starting this one. I estimate that I'll
need maybe just one more to wrap up M16. After that, I should see if I can
consolidate any of this into reusable packages. Though tbh I should wait for
one more region to make sure everything truly is reusable. Tho I do have RCW49..

    Despite the name of this function, this may not be so easy
    I just want a somewhat general function to make PVs from lines or vector
    regions and from any cube. Let's see how I do!

    The first use case will be on Pillar 2 to examine the transverse gradient
    right where the light feature is
    But I suppose I can test it on whatever if it's supposed to be general
    And remember the VOPT VRAD thing..

    Todo: get regions together
    Write the main loop through the cubes
    Decide how you'll pick the reference image (HST? always nice)
    Maybe overlay other regions on the reference (like the polygons to
    point out where the light feature is)

    I'll return to P2 soon, I need to just focus on P1 for the poster I think
    Though this could also work well for the poster if I run with "are these
    all just threads/tails and not gradients?"
